Here my approach to your technical assignment :).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The Challenge 

The challenge was to build 'The Awesome Q/A tool'

### Acceptance Criteria Implemented


- List created questions
- Each answer is hidden by default, opening when clicking
- Add initial question
- Add new question through a form
- Delete all questions
- Sort questions alphabetically 
- Create explanation of each sections (using own implementation of tooltip)

Optional requirements:
- Delete single question 
- Add checkbox for adding a question with 5 seconds delay

## Some things that I could improve/add in the future
- Improve tooltip implementation: current implementation is not scalable, I am assuming a tooltip of max 3 lines, not taking into account the size of the tooltip.
- Implement edit feature
- Add documentation for components (maybe using Docz)
- Move towards typescript, I did not use it because i am not fully familiar with it
- Add testing for the components, so far I just tested everything that has to do with the store.
  
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install all the dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
